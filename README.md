###Pre planning stages involved###

1. scoping the format of the display, i.e. how the data is presented
2. testing code on home VM environment so that functionality would work (particularly php)
3. customising css
4. setting up aws virtual environment
5. testing and finalising code on live environment

**worth nothing that although the brief expected the replacement of the multiples of 3/5 i opted to provide additional context in the form of the
item numbers hence why said numbers were not replaced, but based on the loop it would be easy enough to remove the incremental variable**


###Future improvements###

1. rewriting the function so that it is scalable instead of being static (loop is increment up to 100)
2. allowing parameters to be passed into the function, i.e. parameters for multiples of numbers instead of 3/5, and parameters for the item count
   instead of limiting this to 100
3. UI/UX to be upgraded in line with business specifications
4. colour gradients to represent pass/fail states and types of errors, better visualisation
